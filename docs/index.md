## üìñ Abstract
Standard Laplacian-based contraction (LBC) is prone to mal-contraction in cases where
there is a significant disparity in diameter between trunk and branches. In such cases fine structures experience 
an over-contraction and leading to a distortion of their topological characteristics. In addition, LBC shows a 
topologically incorrect tree skeleton for trunk structures that have holes in the point cloud.In order to address 
these topological artifacts, we introduce semantic Laplacian-based contraction (S-LBC). It integrates semantic 
information of the point cloud into the contraction algorithm
